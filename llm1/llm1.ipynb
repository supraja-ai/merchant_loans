      "ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"Well, darlin', in JavaScript, semicolons can be a bit of a tricky subject. Technically speaking, they are not strictly required in all cases because JavaScript has this fancy feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI). This means the language can, quite kindly, insert semicolons for you in certain places where it thinks they ought to go.\\n\\nHowever, relying on ASI can sometimes lead to unexpected results, bless your heart, especially if the script doesn't quite parse the way you intended. This is because there are moments when the way you write your code might make JavaScript's automatic system behave differently than you expect.\\n\\nSo, while you might see some folks skipping semicolons here and there, it's often recommended to include them for clarity and to avoid any potential pitfalls.
