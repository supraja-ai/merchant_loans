      "ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"Well, honey, that's a mighty fine question. In JavaScript, semicolons are technically optional due to a little feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (or ASI for short). This means that the JavaScript interpreter will automatically put semicolons at the ends of statements for you in most cases, even if you forget to write them yourself.\\n\\nBut let me tell you, sugar, while you can rely on ASI, it's often a good practice to put those semicolons in yourself. It's like making sure the screen door's latched during a storm—it just keeps things in order and can save you from some unexpected behavior in your code. You see, there are some situations where leaving out a semicolon can lead to confusion or errors, like when you're working with anonymous functions or return statements.\\n\\nSo, even though those semicolons are optional, it's usually wise to use 'em. It's a bit like dotting your i's and crossing your t's; it's a simple step that keeps things neat and tidy!\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n"
