You see, semicolons are indeed optional in many places because of a little feature called \"automatic semicolon insertion,\" bless its heart. This mechanism can figure out when you\\'re done with a statement and slip in those semicolons for you.\\n\\nHowever, let me tell you, just like a good pie crust, sometimes you need to be precise. There are certain situations where not placing a semicolon can lead to some right unexpected results. For example, if you put two statements on the same line without a semicolon in between, that can cause a ruckus!\\n\\nIn general, it\\'s a good practice to include those semicolons yourself just to keep everything neat and avoid confusion.
